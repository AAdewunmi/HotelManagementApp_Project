# Student Hostel Management Application

## The Requirements Specification:

* A local university requires a program to manage one of its student hostels, which
contains a number of rooms, each of which can be occupied by a single tenant who
pays rent on a monthly basis. 

* The program must keep a list of tenants and their monthly payments. The information 
held for each tenant will consist of a name, a room number and a list of all the payments 
a tenant has made (month and amount) for one year. 

* The program must allow the user to add and delete tenants, to display
a list of all tenants, to record a payment for a particular tenant, and to display the
payment history of a tenant.
